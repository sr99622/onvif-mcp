    POST to OpenClaw's /hooks/camera-motion endpoint (a named hook mapping
    configured in openclaw.json, NOT the generic /hooks/agent path),
    telling the agent exactly what to do and where to find the snapshot
    and description - naming the exact tools and paths up front, rather
    than leaving the agent to rediscover a working sequence through
    trial and error on every motion event (get_snapshot_image_base64_encoded
    and the browser tool both proved unusable to it in earlier testing).

    Does NOT ask OpenClaw to fetch the snapshot itself. The caller
    (_on_event_listener_event) already wrote it directly to
    CAMERA_EVENTS_DIR (a real "~/onvif-events" path on this same
    machine) at alarm time, via _fetch_motion_snapshot. Trajectory review
    (2026-07-22, 5 clean runs) showed OpenClaw's own
    camera__download_snapshot_to_file step re-queries the camera's live
    snapshot URL again, ~4.5s+ after the alarm on average once its model
    reasoning gets around to calling it - since that endpoint returns
    whatever the camera sees at request time, not a buffered frame from
    the alarm, that second fetch can be a materially different moment
    than the one that actually triggered the event (confirmed visually:
    consecutive live snapshots 5s apart showed a clearly different pose).
    Telling OpenClaw the file already exists and to just `read` it
    removes that second fetch entirely, so the image it describes is the
    same one captured at alarm time. This also removes one full tool
    round-trip (and its ~4.5s model reasoning step) from every
    notification, on top of the earlier camera__get_camera removal.

    Requires an openclaw.json hooks.mappings entry like:

        {
          "id": "camera-motion",
          "match": { "path": "camera-motion" },
          "action": "agent",
          "wakeMode": "now",
          "name": "Camera Motion",
          "messageTemplate": "{{payload.message}}",
          "allowUnsafeExternalContent": true
        }

    allowUnsafeExternalContent must live in this mapping config, NOT in
    the JSON body we send: normalizeAgentPayload() (the generic
    /hooks/agent request parser) doesn't recognize that field at all, so
    sending it directly in our payload was silently dropped - confirmed
    by trajectory review showing the SECURITY NOTICE wrapper still
    present after we started sending it. Worse, /hooks/agent and
    /hooks/wake are special-cased in the request router and always
    return before hooks.mappings is ever consulted, so no mapping -
    including one matched by source rather than path - can apply to
    those two paths regardless of config. A mapped path is the only way
    to reach allowUnsafeExternalContent at all.

    Without it, OpenClaw wraps this message in a SECURITY NOTICE +
    EXTERNAL_UNTRUSTED_CONTENT boundary (since hook requests default to
    externalContentSource: "webhook"), telling the model not to follow
    instructions embedded in it - directly undermining the explicit
    numbered steps below. We control both the sender (this script) and
    the content (our own instructions), so this isn't actually untrusted
    third-party content; it's just labeled that way by default. Batch
    trajectory review showed the majority of sampled motion-event runs
    called get_snapshot_image_base64_encoded anyway - the exact tool
    step 1 explicitly says not to use - despite that instruction being
    present in every one of those runs, so this is a hypothesis to test
    against fresh, controlled events, not a confirmed fix.

    Create a new PTZ preset, or overwrite an existing one with the camera's

    This function queries the camera directly via ONVIF using its IP
    address (with credentials from environment variables), builds a full
    Camera object, and edits it before pushing. No JSON payload is
    needed - just the camera's IP address.

    Two modes, based on whether preset_token is supplied:

    - preset_token omitted (create mode): the camera creates a brand new
      preset at its current position. Cameras support a limited number of
      presets - check how many already exist (e.g. via get_cameras'
      ptz_presets) before creating another, in case the camera silently
      rejects it once full. If preset_name is given, the new preset is
      created first, then renamed in a second call - the underlying ONVIF
      operation can't assign a name to a preset that doesn't have a token
      yet, so this tool creates it unnamed, determines the token the
      camera just assigned, then renames it. The camera doesn't move
      between these two calls, so the rename call safely re-saves the
      same position.

    - preset_token supplied (overwrite mode): the preset matching that
      token has its position overwritten to the camera's CURRENT
      position - not restored to wherever it used to point. If you only
      want to rename an existing preset without moving it, first call
      goto_camera_preset to move the camera back to that preset's own
      position, THEN call this tool - otherwise the preset's saved
      position will be silently replaced with wherever the camera
      happens to be sitting right now. Pass preset_name to also update
      the preset's stored name at the same time.

    Args:
        ip_address: The IP address of the camera to command.
        profile_token: The media profile token to command (almost always

    x and y are normalized velocities in the range -1.0 to 1.0 (0.0 means
    no motion on that axis): positive x pans right, negative x pans left;
    positive y tilts up, negative y tilts down. These are velocities, not
    positions - the camera keeps moving in that direction at that speed
    until stop_camera_pan_tilt is called.

    This does not stop on its own except at the camera's physical pan/tilt
    limits - most PTZ hardware halts at its mechanical range ends, so
    forgetting to stop is not unsafe, but the camera will simply drift to
    whichever limit it's heading toward and park there rather than stopping
    at a precise point. Call stop_camera_pan_tilt to halt motion exactly
    where you want it, or check that camera's ptz_status field via a fresh
    get_cameras call to see where it ended up.

    This is pan/tilt only - it has no effect on zoom. Use zoom_camera
    separately for zoom; a camera can only perform one of pan/tilt or zoom
    at a time.

    Subscribe a camera to an ONVIF event topic and mark it as observed.

    Updates this server's own bookkeeping (visible afterward as that
    camera's subscribed_events list in get_cameras) AND performs the
    real ONVIF subscription on the camera itself - adding just this one
    topic, without touching any of the camera's other active
    subscriptions (this mirrors ONVIF's own Subscribe operation, which
    is likewise additive/per-topic). All cameras share one underlying
    event listener - the first call to this tool or
    unsubscribe_all_events, for any camera, starts it; every subsequent
    call (for that camera or any other) reuses it.

    If the real subscription fails (e.g. the camera is unreachable), the
    bookkeeping change is rolled back rather than left showing a topic
    as subscribed when it isn't.

    event_topic is not validated against the camera's real topics here -
    it should be one of the strings in that camera's event_topics list
    (from get_cameras), but a typo will be sent to the camera as a
    literal (and likely rejected or silently non-matching) topic filter.

    Args:
        ip_address: The IP address of the camera.
        event_topic: The event topic string to add, e.g.
